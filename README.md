# Sentiment-Analysis-R
In this project we aim to create insightful graphs that indicate customer sentiments towards e-commerce website, i.e. Flipkart. In addition training will be undertaken for the Naïve Bayes classifiers to classify tweets according to their overall sentiments and check the accuracy of results. PART 1.1:  In this part, we will extract a minimum of 1000 tweets of competing brand and prepare data using various cleaning steps. The polarity and sentiment score for each tweet is calculated and used for creating individual and comparative plots. We will learn about various packages and methods for data cleaning for data preparation. PART 1.2: In this part we will use Naïve Bayes (Supervised Algorithm) for prediction of tweet sentiment as positive, negative or neutral (in terms of emotions such as happy, sad or excited). We will also learn to create confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy of their algorithm.
